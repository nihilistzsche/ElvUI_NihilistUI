12.06:
- MerathilisUI removed paragon reputation support, and has suggested moving to ParagonReputation, so
  paragon reputation color will now be obtained from that addon instead.
- Readded a mover for the OldGodWhispers addon.
- Fixed an issue where VUF unit frames could appear during pet battles.
- Installer updates to MerathilisUI, mMediaTag, NihilistzscheUI, ParagonReputation, and ProjectAzilroka

12.05:
- Fix remaing DF issues.

12.04:
- Preliminary DF update, some minor issues remain.

12.03:
- 9.2.7 update and synced to the latest ElvUI version.
- This will be the last Shadowlands version, with an update for the prepatch coming around Thursday next week.

12.01:
While rewriting a portion of the NihilistUI installer to work globally it was no longer installing nameplate filters for all classes, that's been fixed. The ElvUI nameplate filter install step has also been brought out to a "global" function that is run once instead of the same values being set 12 times.

12.00:
This one gets a major version release change because I made a change to the code style I write the addon in that affected over 5000 lines of it, so seemed like a worthwhile change to bump the number.
ElvUI_mMediaTag support has been added to the installer, enabling class colored nameplate borders and the mythic keystone \!key\[s\] command.
The default size of the player and target aurabars and horizontal castbar have been reduced.
The default size of the pet aurabars has been reduced and they are now enabled by default.

11.12:
The installer will no longer set nameplate names to invalid tags when CustomTags is not available.
A new font size option has been added to the main NihilistUI options page, changing this changes the value the chat is set to at login.
The portal bar now also blacklists its items from the MerathilisUI Auto Buttons, but both it and the raid prep bar have been rewritten to only query the server if an item has not already been blacklisted significantly reducing the load this addon generates on all but the first login.

11.11:
A skilet installer was added, though it is a very work in progress I'm still working on how I want to use it.
The UIScale should now no longer be so aggressively changed.

11.10:
The installer has been reworked and should hopefully no longer error for those of you having issues with it.
The cutaway textures on the vertical unit frames are now rotated so if you use a noticeable texture like I do they match the statusbars they are anchored to.
I have noticed an issue with the VUF Player Frame sometimes fading even when casting, and I have changed how the cast system works a little to hopefully eliminate this.

11.09: (this release was not publically released)
Minor updates mostly to the backend of how the addon works, though one notable fix is the fix on the shadow on the Experience Bar. Pet Battle Nameplates has a fix for the nameplates sometimes showing empty.

11.08:
** New**
Added a new Engineer Toy Bar to the Utility Bars. You no longer need to clutter your favorite toys (and your toy bar) with toys that only some of your characters will use. The engineer toy bar will automatically fill with engineering toys that are pre-defined. You can disable specific items from the options window; and if you notice a toy is missing that you think should be there; please let me know.

**Fixed**
Warlock Demons: Rewrote how the spawn/despawn of demons is handled to prevent a situation where the non-nameplate sorting of the bars would inevitably suffer a lua error. Nether Portal all day long now and no issues should occur.
Installer: The installer was wrongly trying to apply all of the "ElvUI modifiers" during spec profile setup even if the associated addon was not enabled, this has been changed so the installer should no longer be attempting to setup missing addons. Various changes to the installer, as always it is my personal setup but the main changes were moving the tracker bar, location plus panel, portal bar, and minimap down lower so they dont overlap the datatext panels.

11.07: Health prediction for the VUF are now handled by ElvUI, options have been mirrored to respective unit options in VUF. When ProjectAzilroka is installed, the PetBattleNameplates will not set hardcoded text, instead the installer sets up a new style filter to apply PBUF tags from ProjectAzilroka to the nameplates instead. Fixed Shadowlands food on the raid prep bar and added Shadowlands bait to the bait bar.
11.06: Added support for ElvUI's pet "colorPetByUnitClass" option to the Vertical Unit Frames. Reworked how the installer initializes to try to eliminate a race condition that appears to be causing lua errors to occur in places they shouldn't.
Installer changes:
* Added colorPetByUnitClass to both raid pets and pets.
* Adjusted the ProjectAzilroka Torghast Buffs moving it slightly lower so it no longer collides with the FarmBar.
11.05: Some lua error fixes, FarmBar updates, installer updates.
I'm aware of an issue where using the installer and logging into or reloading the ui after install on a class that uses spec profiles (all but the pure-DPS classes) will receive lua errors and VUF will be broken. Reloading the UI once fixes the issue and it doesnt not appear again unless the installer is run again.
Also I should note unlike previous versions; skipping the installer is now recorded as permanent. You can remove the skipped flag and receive new installer updates by running the installer again manually through the ElvUI Options window.
11.04: First public release of the Shadowlands version.
I'd also like to announce that I will be developing a version of NihilistUI for Classic soon as well, finally.

10.05-10.06:
Nothing materially changed here. Just had to fix my release script so had to keep bumping the number.

I would like to personally apologize to each and every one of you for the sorry state of affairs that was the 10.02 and 10.03 releases. I will try to take more care in the future to prevent anything like this from happening again.

10.04:
- Updates to some things to match ElvUI 11.21.
- Fixed ButtonStyle when MerathilisUI is not present.

10.03:
- Moved back to the original ElvUI_NihilistUI/ElvUI_NihilistUI_OptionsUI setup. The other way is too much work to maintain. A future version will include plans laid out for stopping disabled modules from using memory but this release was too important to get out now.
- The RaidCD default anchors have been moved.
- WarlockDemons uses a new method to detect when it can attach to nameplates making it more reliable.
- Readded latency to the VUF castbars.
- VUF frame width and height were stored in the profile, but options were never added. Frame width and height is now dynamically calculated based on health width and height, and the width of the power bar if the power bar is attached to the health bar.
- The way VUF frames are setup has been changed to EnhancedShadows work properly around them.
- VUF now properly supports all of the ElvUI UF color options (found in its normal place). Please report if you notice something that doesn't.
- Have a reworked oUF_GCD that works properly, and I was able to remove all of the dumb hacks around GCD.
- The Conch of Warmondi has been added to the portal bar as well.
- VUF CustomTexts should work again.

10.02:
- Special Note: BenikUI compatibility in this version is based on current dev version of BenikUI. It will break if using the current (as of July 29th 2019) released version of BenikUI. Please either disable BenikUI or refrain from updating NihilistUI until BenikUI has also updated.
- Updated Cutaway code in VUF to match the new version of Cutaway in ElvUI 11.20
- Added the G.E.A.R Tracking Beacon from the Gnome Heritage Armor questline to the portal bar.
- Fixed a lua error with the specswitch bar.

10.01:
- VUF unitframes now use the same color setting coe the regular UF unitframes use so that they look identical to the original unitframes ElvUI has.
- Cutaway health is enabled for all unitframes in the installer.

10.00:
- The various modules ElvUI_NihilistUI provides are now loaded by individual addons. While the runtime enable/disable state still exists for all of them, you can now prevent them from loading entirely by disabling them in your addons window. Please report any issues arising from disable modules to my git.
- Ran luacheck on NihilistUI and fixed over 1000 issues reported by it. Things may have been broken by this, I think I caught most of it, but again, if you run into any issues please report them.
- VerticalUnitFrames has had healing prediction fixed, cutaway health is working finally, and the portrait has been reworked to more closely resemble the portrait on default ElvUI frames. The default camDistanceScale on the portraits has been changed from 1 to 1.3.
- ButtonStyle has been neutered and now exists only to provide shadows. I received an Icon pack from someone (who will announce it when they are ready) that has removed the need for the overlay portion of it.
- Masque support has been completely removed.
- EnhancedShadows has been added to the BenikUI Taxi Button ("Request stop") and the Pet Battle Action Bar, as well as nameplate auras when using EnhancedNameplateAuras.

9.23:
- Added a nameplate custom style filter "Demon About To Expire" for warlocks that is a condition that triggers when a wild imp has less than 3 energy remaining or a demon has less than 5 seconds remaining. This requires ElvUI versions higher than the released 11.18 (at time of this release the development version on git).
- Lots of bug fixes to various modules.
- Installer rework and updates.
- Fixed the Zygor installer.

9.22:
- There is a bug with the Warlock Demons timer bars attaching to nameplates that can only be fixed by a new method that is available in ElvUI versions higher than 11.14 (at the time of this update only the development version). This option will be ignored when the needed method does not exist.
- Fixed a bug with the InFlight misc hook when enhanced shadows is disabled.

9.21:
- Warlock Demons can now attach the timer bars to friendly npc nameplates when those are available. It will fall back to the original mode inside instances where friendly nameplates are not available, or if friendly minion nameplates are not enabled.
- Fixed bugs that prevented the cooldown bar and hidden artifact tracker from properly disabling.

9.20:
- Added options to the Raid CDs to disable tracking cooldowns you dont want to see.
- Added 4 more datatext panels when using dtbars2 because I needed more.

9.181, 9.182, 9.183:
- Fixed the Zandalari Troll crest that appears to have been corrupted.
- Updated some installer settings. As more users are using the UI, I would like to take the time to remind you that unlike other plugin installers that allow you to pick and choose which part of the UI you wish to install, the NihilistUI installer is a one-button install meant for my own personal use and offers no configuration to it.
- Had some various issues with git which is why the version jump to 9.183.

9.18:
- Warlock demons has been changed so that it will now create multiple columns instead of continuining to grow. Its default position has been moved to the top center of the screen with this change.
- Added an outline setting to the hidden artifact tracker.

9.17:
- Removed the "vertstatusbar" texture setting from UnitFrames, the Vertical Unit Frames will now just use the normal UnitFrame status bar setting.
- Fixed a bug with how the race crest is displayed in NihilistChat.
- The QuestXP bar will now use the current War Mode Bonus percent when calculating quest xp when War Mode is enabled.
- Added EnhancedShadows to ClassicQuestLog and LightHeaded when they are installed and enabled.
- The NihilistUI installer will now set friendly npc and player nameplates to name only.
- Hopefully fix "You are not in a party." messages caused by PartyXP.

- Fixed the power bars in the Vertical Unit Frames not having the proper texture.
- Added an installer for Zygor, but please note that this installer simply turns off *all* of the enhancements. If you run the NihilistUI and wish to use these enhancements please turn them back on in your Zygor settings.

9.15:
- Fixed a lua error with the XP and Honor databar notifiers.

9.14:
- Cleaned up the databar notifiers even further to reduce code bloat.

9.13:
- Added missing blood elf and worgen race crests, should prevent green squares on the chat panels if the installer is run when you are one of those races.

9.12:
- Dummy release due to repository corruption that I had to fix.

9.11:
- Added Kul Tiran and Zandalari Troll race crests so the chat textures will work for them.

9.10:
- Optimized the RaidCD update function some.

9.06:
- Fixed a long-standing bug that prevented the raid target indicator from working on the VUF, in addition, added size options to the raid target indicator.

- Fixed a typo that was in the colored NihilistUI text in various places.

8.03:

- Updates to make it match changes made to ElvUI in my absence.
- Enhanced Nameplate Auras return for the new oUF nameplates.

8.01:
- Rewrote a bunch of things to bring them up to my more modern coding standards. Please report if you see anything broken or not working.
- PartyXP now supports tags. The full list can be viewed in ElvUI_ChaoticUI/modules/partyxp/utility/tags.lua. They are used the same way oUF tags are used, just like CustomWatchBar tags.

- If you change the installer texture and font, it gets saved now, and will pop up the installer again for alts if you changed it from the last time you installed (or had never run the installer with the new changes. This only applies if you change the texture and font, if you dont change them, and skip the installer, it should not show up again unless I bump the installer version.
- Ticks on databars and castbars are now only half-height and start at the top of the bar (or left of the bar for vertical castbars) to give the bars a more modern look.

7.11:
- Fixed EnhancedNameplateAuras which have been broken since 6.11. Apologies.
- The following features from BenikUI and MerathilisUI that had been previously automatically disabled are no longer done so as they are not directly incompatible with ChaoticUI:

- Added more MerathilisUI styling because it is just the best thx Mera.
- Some more backend changes that should have no effect on anything.

7.04:
- TL; DR: Bug fixes and shadows.

- Changed the way the player vertical unit frame is constructed to try to reduce copy/paste code. Please let me know if you run into any issues.
- MerathilisUI has added incompatiblity checks to his UI in recent development versions, therefore I have removed some checks from my UI. This may cause some incompatibilities to surface while he prepares his 3.37 release.
- Changed inverted shadows so they can co-exist alongside normal shadows and welp now theres double shadows on all of the buttons and auras cause this UI can not ever have enough shadows. Disabling inverted shadows in buttonstyle can remove the inner shadow, and disabling enhanced shadows can remove the outer shadow.
- Enhanced Shadows will now surround RaidCD categories and the Warlock Demons bars, as well as a more visible shadow on the minimap.
- Fixed bugs in Warlock Demons that were causing the bars to just be off. They went back to school and got their GED.

- ElvUI Shadow & Light is no longer a required dependency, though remains highly recommended.
- For MerathilisUI: The raid markers had previously been marked incompatible, but they are not and should not have been, this has been corrected. In addition, the microBar is no longer automatically disabled when ElvUI_LocPlus is installed, but you will want to move it as its default position overlaps the location bar.
- DynamicCam support has been added to the installer, again reflecting my personal preferences.
- Fixed a bug where gaining a level from gaining azerite XP would not properly update the message from the databarnotifier.
- Backend changes as always.

- Masque is now included in the installer, the skin used by the installer is Masque: Darion, if you do not have that installed it will not properly install.
- Added Battle for Azeroth buff food, flasks, and augment rune to the raidprepbar.

DragonOverlay, EnhancedPetBattleUI and OzCooldowns remain integrated with NenaUI.

I did this to remove the bloat from NenaUI and allow you to customize your ElvUI more freely.

All of the various utility bars have been moved under one Utility Bars module, and their respective configuration pages can now be found in the Utility Bars module page in the NenaUI config.

There is now an option, disabled by default, to hide the utility bars in combat.

There is now an option, enabled by default, to enable/disable the Enhanced Shadows.

Added a new module BetterReputationColors that allows you to customize your faction colors.

The default position of the trackerbar, farmbar, and raidprepbar has moved to the top left under the data panel.

Bug fixes.
